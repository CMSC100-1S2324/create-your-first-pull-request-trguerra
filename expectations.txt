Firstly, I hope that I will be able to pass this CMSC 100 class. For my expectations, since this is a new coding practice/environment, I hope that I will be able to learn well with the guide of my peers and instructor.

//@nieto - I agree with your expectations. I also hope to pass this course and hope that I will learn from everyone
